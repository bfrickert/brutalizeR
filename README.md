#brutalizeR (WORK IN PROGRESS)
Testing the potency of representative samples of the black metal and death metal musical subgenres.

What is the *brutality.coef* by which a Satyricon song must be multiplied and added to "Vacation" by the Go-Go's before "Vacation" is identified as **black metal** by a support vector machine?

How is that coefficient different from the coefficient that must be applied to, say, a song by Watain or Mayhem?

And what kind of *brutality.coef* must be applied to Morbid Angel and Obituary songs to make "Vacation" appear as a **death metal** song to that same support vector machine?

TODO: 
      

      When does SVM label it `is.black.metal`?
      Record it.
      Move on to next song.
      Do this a bunch of times.

      Create shiny app.
