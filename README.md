#brutalizeR
Testing the potency of representative sample songs from the black metal musical subgenre.

This repo dares to quantify the *brutality coefficient* by which a Satyricon song must be multiplied and added to "Vacation" by the Go-Go's before "Vacation" -- statistically speaking -- looks like **black metal**?

It all so dares to investigate how that number differs from the coefficients that must be applied to, say, a song by Watain or Mayhem, with the understanding that the brutality of a song is indirectly proportional to the size of the **brutality coefficient**.

This repo contains the code that comprises and supports the landmark [brutalizeR](bfrickert.shinyapps.io/brutalizeR) data app.
