Life betrayal - a warping rage
Evil ripping caverns through your mind
Immolation - in blood you've signed your soul away
Sickening life ends but the horror has just begun
Vultures moaning a funeral dirge
Walls await to cradle you and rip your soul apart
Incessant screams echoes through the maze

Insanity approaches - imminent demise
Maze of torment...
Maze of death

Stricken from the holy book deliverance to pain
Effigy of jesus christ burning in your mind
Voices cry out to bid you welcome
Locked within the dungeons of darkness - no escape!!!

Maze of torment...
Maze of death

Passing through corridors embedded with
Scars of those who have gone before you
And left their marks
Warning comes to late to save you now

Visions of suffering stab from the inside

You pray for death
Mourning does no good as you can only die once

Souls are being raped by the maze
Lost in these halls... Endlessly

Maze of torment...
Maze of death
