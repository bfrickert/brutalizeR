Come on, don't do well
where I feed the living hearts
I got a torch to light
Feel these smelter fires burn
I don't care what they say !
I don't care ! I'll do what I want !
I am by your side
tell me you think what to do
No way, I don't fear
Slow down, follow in my grave
Your ways, I despise
Go forth and get with your own kind
We've got fumes to behold
Setting, one size of fortune
Farewell to great friends
these will face the burning sun
tattoed shadows lifted
Fear not, like the burning plague !
Repeat chorus
Bright light the sear his face
Pitfalls twisted
Call me far from now
I survived through all this hell
I DON'T CARE !!!
DON'T CARE !!!!!
I really don't care !
